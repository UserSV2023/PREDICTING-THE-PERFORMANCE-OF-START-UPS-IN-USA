# PREDICTING-THE-PERFORMANCE-OF-START-UPS-IN-USA

**ABSTRACT:**
Startups have become a vital contributor to economic growth by bringing new ideas, spurring innovation, and creating employment opportunities. However, predicting the success of a startup remains a complex challenge due to the high level of uncertainty and failure rates associated with startups. The following dataset provides industry trends, investment insights, and individual company information to help investors identify startups with the potential for rapid growth and success. With 45 features, including funding rounds, total funding, milestones, and industry type, this dataset can offer valuable insights into the factors that contribute to a startup's success or failure. The target variable is the startup's “Status” (acquired or closed), can be used to make informed decisions and gain a competitive edge in the market. 

**Data Source and Description:**

**GOAL OF THE PROJECT:**
The goal of this project would be to precisely forecast the possibility of success or failure for a certain startup, depending on pertinent factors and data points. As a result, the model may give information to investors, business owners, and other stakeholders who are interested in startup’s success rates and other useful insights. The model would have to include things like market or industry trends, financial performance, financing history, and other data points. 

**Data Exploration** – We will look at the following queries using summary statistics and visualization tools:
1.	What is the overall success/failure rate of startups in various places and categories?
2.	The link between various financing categories and qualities, such as the first and last funding time differences, location, date of foundation, rounds of funding, milestones, etc.

**Prediction Model** – To predict the startup’s success or failure, we will use various classification models.
1.	Data Understanding and Preparation: Here, we may execute data cleaning, merging, exploration, removing/fixing missing values, feature engineering, checking for duplicates, etc.
2.	Modelling: Using accessible and significant features discovered via data exploration, we will apply classification models to forecast the performance for startups (column: status (acquired/closed)).
3.	Validation: Create performance measures and validate the model's effectiveness using test data.
4.	Conclusion: What can we learn from our classification model for the performance of startups and how can we use this model to help investors make informed investment decisions in startups?
